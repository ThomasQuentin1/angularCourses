    To bill and collect money owed to us. This includes sending you emails, invoices, receipts, notices of delinquency, and alerting you if we need a different credit card number.

We use a third party to place cookies on your computer to collect non-personally identifiable information to compile aggregated statistics for us about visitors to our site. Your browser may provide you with the option to refuse some or all browser cookies. You may also be able to remove cookies from your browser. For more information about how to manage browser cookies, please follow the instructions provided by your browser. Our Web Pages may also contain electronic images known as “web beacons” (sometimes called “singlepixel gifs”). We use web beacons together with cookies to compile aggregated statistics to analyze how our Web Pages are used. We may also use web beacons in some of our emails to let us know which emails and links have been opened by recipients. This allows us to gauge the effectiveness of our customer communications and marketing campaigns. We use a third party to gather information about how you and others use our Web Pages. For example, we will know how many users access a specific page and which links they clicked on. We use this information in the aggregate ONLY to understand and optimize how our site is used.
